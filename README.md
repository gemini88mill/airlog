# Overview

Airlog (working title) a flight logger for families to share their flight data. 

The original purpose of this app was that my wife used an app called flighty, which was a mac exclusive. Since I have no intention of getting an apple system just for an app, I would like to make my own with the features that my wife and I use. Specifically, the Flight map, flight history and real time flight tracking. 

My wife is a flight attendant and I would like to have real time (or near real time) updates on when she lands from a flight. I would like to use this app to track my flights and share them with a group of friends that I might be visiting or meeting up with. I would like to review my flights and trips from time to time and get an interactive map to see the places that I visited and flights that I took.
